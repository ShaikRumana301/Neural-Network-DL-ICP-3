Student ID: 700752115, Student Name: Rumana Shaik

The following steps are followed for ICP-3:

1. In Jupiter notepad written the code for the following scenario's and mentioned the comments for the code and uploaded the "ICP-3.ipynb" to repo:
   a)Created a class Employee and did the following
   -> Created a data member to count the number of Employees
   -> Created a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
   -> Created a function to average salary
   -> Created a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
   -> Created the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions.
   b) Numpy
   -> Using NumPy created a random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20.
   -> Then reshape the array to 4 by 5
   -> Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)(Did not implemented it via for loop)
   
3. In the "Neural Networks & DL ICP-3 Screenshots & Github link.pdf" file consists of screenshots of the resultant compiled code and Github link to the repository.
4. In the "ICP-3 Recording.mp4" file consists of Video regarding the technical explanation of the code.
